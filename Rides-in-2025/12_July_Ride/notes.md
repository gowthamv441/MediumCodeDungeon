Pros:
* Good on creating object
* Good at finding the pattern

Cons:
* didnt clearly sketch the logic before coding
* wrongly created minheap by giving weightage to event that is attended less number of time than event that is ending earlier
* made issues with iteration while adding to queue and polling from queue
* Inefficiency in finding the event that starting on curr Day
* didnt properly think of time complexity

---

Remediation mechanism:
* Before coding, spend 3â€“5 mins writing down & come up with logic
* Think of TC with the logic thought of
* Formulate high level logic and type out in commented fashion
